          <p>
            I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an
            Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in
            stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where
            you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user
            experiences while staying fashionable.

          <p>
            In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the
            right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to
            deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale — performance
            and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
